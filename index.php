              <p>
                I am a 1st year graduate student in the Department of Astrophysics and Astronomy at the University of Toronto.
                Presently, I am working with Professor Diana Valencia on tidal heating of terrestrial planet surfaces.

                I am interested in a broad range of topics related to planetary system dynamics, planet formation and protoplanetary discs.
                Numerical methods such as CFD and NBody simulations appear frequently in my work and I am also interested in analytic/mathematical methods for solving nonlinear problems.
                In the past, I have worked on problems such as planet migration, impact cratering and dynamically fitting rv signals for planetary systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of my research I enjoy teaching and have been a teaching assistant for several physics, math, computer science and astronomy courses.
                When I am not at work I like to be outdoors, these days I mainly hike and mountain bike but I also like cross country skiing, climbing and kayaking.
                I also usually commute around Toronto by bike, it is a great way to stay fit while also saving time in your day!
