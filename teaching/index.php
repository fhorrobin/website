            <h3>MATA35 - Winter 2019</h3>
            I will post material for weekly tutorial sessions here within a few days after the tutorial. I may also post other potentially helpful files
            such as solutions to important problems.

            <h4>Tutorial 1</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Basics of matrices and row reduction.</li>
                <li>A1 is due next week (Week of Jan 21). </li>
                <li>Link to my <a href="teaching/files/tutorial1.pdf">notes</a>.</li>
