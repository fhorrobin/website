            <h3>MATA35 - Winter 2019</h3>
            <p>I will post material for weekly tutorial sessions here within a few days after the tutorial. I may also post other potentially helpful files
            such as solutions to important problems.</p>

            <h4>Office Hours:</h4>
            <p>I will hold office hours for 2 hours each week. The times (for now) are: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tuesdays 1-2PM in AC312</li>
                <li>Fridays 2-3 in IC404</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If these times do not work and you would like to setup an appointment send me an email. Note that I will not answer math questions via email so you must ask them either in tutorial or office hours.</p>

            <h4>Tutorial 1</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Basics of matrices and row reduction.</li>
                <li>A1 is due next week (Week of Jan 21). </li>
                <li>Link to my <a href="/~fhorrobin/teaching/files/tutorial1.pdf">notes</a>.</li>
            </ul>
