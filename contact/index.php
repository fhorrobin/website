                    If you are a student in one of the courses I TA, please include the course code at the beggining of the subject. I will not respond
                    to emails from students that are not sent from official UofT email addresses. Please note that I typically only answer emails 3 times
                    per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday morning) other than colleagues and faculty I am currently working with.
